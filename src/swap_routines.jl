    for each replica that maps the current configuration to the new

    spin configurations inside the regions are compared to see where they
    disagree. Every site where they disagree, an entry is added the
    appropriate spin list in Electron Tinder. Finally, the completed
    ElectronTinder database is fed into SwipeRight to generate a list of moves.

    After this, the list of moves are submitted to preexisting functions
    to compute the determinant ratio produced by that sequence of moves.

    Finally what is returned is the expectation value of the swap operator
    acting on this region which is,
    det(swapped copy 1)*det(swapped copy 2) / (det(og copy 1) * det(og copy 2))
